        The Lagos carnival also known as the Fanti or Caretta Carnival of
        Lagos, is the most prominent in West Africa. The carnival is usually
        held during the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, a colorful folk
        festival which holds annually in Lagos. The origins of the carnival
        dates back to the Lagos colonial period when the Brazilian former
        slave returnees came back to reside in Lagos in the 19th century. The
        carnival was re-instated in 2010. The event is usually centered on
        Lagos Island, filled with troop displays of costumes and various forms
        of entertainment including music and dancing. The carnival portrays an
        eclectic mixture of Nigerian, Brazilian and Cuban heritage of the
        city. The Lagos Carnival is filled with amazing and memorable
        activities.This festival is one of the most colorful and celebrated
        cultural festivals in Nigeria and quite notable in Africa generally.
